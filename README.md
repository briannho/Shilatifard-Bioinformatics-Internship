# Shilatifard Laboratory - Bioinformatics Internship

The main objective was to reproduce the methods and validate the results of two papers published by the lab. Paper 1 is titled "Targeting Processive Transcription Elongation via SEC Disruption for MYC-Induced Cancer Therapy." Paper 2 is titled "TET2 coactivates gene expression through demethylation of enhancers." Upon completion, my work has demonstrated that the results can be reproduced, thus validating them. However, the methods explained in the papers are quite unclear and could use some refining.

This repository contains all the python and shell scripts I've coded and executed in order to process, transform, and analyze the data, and subsequently generating graphs and figures. Each folder pertains to a specific paper. Within each folder, there is a shell script that documents all of the commands executed for the analysis of all the figures for a particular paper. There are also sub folders containing scripts and datasets specific to a figure presented in the paper. 

Note, all original data were taken from NCBI. Some of the datasets were too large, thus were not allowed to be uploaded.
