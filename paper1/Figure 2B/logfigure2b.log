=====================================
Analysis should be initiated either with a base space directory, or a fastq directory, or a bam directory.  Below you can see what was specified in this run.
BaseSpaceDirectory: 
Fastq Directory: /projects/b1025/brian/paper1/figure2b/rep1
Bam Directory: 
Output Directory: /projects/b1025/brian/paper1/figure2b/rep1/outputfigure2b
Type of Analysis: chipseq
=====================================
Analysis plan:
Will trim fastq files according to trailing quality scores with Trimmomatic (TRAILING:30 MINLEN:20).
Will build scripts for aligning fastq reads with bowtie.
Will run scripts for aligning fastq reads with bowtie.
Will build scripts for calling peaks according to the experimental plan in /projects/b1025/brian/paper1/figure2b/rep1/chipfigure2b.csv.
Will run scripts for calling peaks.
Will make tracks appropriate for the UCSC genome browser.
Will upload tracks to Shilatifard account on Amazon S3 (if user has correct credentials).
