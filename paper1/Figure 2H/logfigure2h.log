=====================================
Analysis should be initiated either with a base space directory, or a fastq directory, or a bam directory.  Below you can see what was specified in this run.
BaseSpaceDirectory: 
Fastq Directory: /projects/b1025/brian/paper1/figure2h/
Bam Directory: 
Output Directory: /projects/b1025/brian/paper1/figure2h/outputfigure2h
Type of Analysis: chipseq
=====================================
Analysis plan:
Will trim fastq files according to trailing quality scores with Trimmomatic (TRAILING:30 MINLEN:20).
Will build scripts for aligning fastq reads with bowtie.
Will run scripts for aligning fastq reads with bowtie.
Will make tracks appropriate for the UCSC genome browser.
Will upload tracks to Shilatifard account on Amazon S3 (if user has correct credentials).
